## Component Design
* Every Part in a webpage is a component.
* Before you start coding, we must plan for creating each component.
* Follow Modularity, Reusability, Readability, and Testability
* Lazy loading delays loading components until they are needed, improving performance by reducing initial page load times.
* Don't write any component code above 100 lines. Instead of writing more than 100 lines, split it into different parts.

### SRP
* Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

### Industry Standards 
* Don't write above 100 lines.
