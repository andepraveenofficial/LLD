### Config Driven UI
* We can control the Frontend UI from the Backend.
* Config-driven UI is a technique that allows you to create dynamic and customizable UIs without hardcoding them.
* The config-driven is a large JSON file that decides how the UI looks.
* The config-driven UI is determined by the backend developers.
* Config-driven UI is also (different names) as backend-driven UI, dynamic UI layout, or server-driven UI.
* In this approach, backend developers decide the UI layout as well.
* Everything is driven by Backend Developers.

### Advantages of config driven UI 
* We can create multiple UIs with the same code.
* If you want to change the UI on the frontend, you just change the config file on the backend.
